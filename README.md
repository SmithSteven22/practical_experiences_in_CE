# Task description

The objective is to assess different camera-based machine vision approaches for guiding a manipulator end-effector (eef) during a pick and place task

Tasks:
1) Find different ROS software packages that can be integrated with a camera for object recognition
2) Develop a software pipeline that takes the coordinates of an object (based on machine vision) and guides the eef to pick the object
  - To develop the pipeline, feel free to use ar_track_alvar for object recognition and MoveIt with xArm7 manipulator. 
3) Assess the quality, stability, speed, ease-of-integration for different machine-vision solutions. Make sure to highlight any bottlenecks and technical limitations in the final report. 

Deliverable results:
1) Video demonstrations of vision-based eef guidance (at minimum: physical camera, simulated robot)
2) Code and documentation is available on GitHub
3) Final written report that describes the outputs of each task



# My plan
- [x] **Read and understand the problem**
- [x] **Get familiar with xarm7 and moveit**
- Moveit capabilities
-	Launch xarm7 in moveit
- [x] **Perception**
-	understand and use usb_cam (camera) in moveit environment
-	Investigate tf and add the camera to the robotâ€™s environment (base_link)
- [x] **Approach**\
Use tf to keep track of different coordinates and object of interest. 
- [x] **ar_track_alvar**
- [x] **vision_opencv**
- [x] **find_object_2d**
